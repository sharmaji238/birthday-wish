export const ROMANTIC_MESSAGE = `My Dearest Love,
Zukafuka !

I know we've had misunderstandings, and I may not always find the right words or the right way to show what I feel. But I need you to know this — I do care. More than I’m able to express.

Even when I get it wrong, even when it looks like I’m not trying, you still matter to me more than anything happening around us.

I'm not perfect, but my intention has always been genuine. My priority has always been you.”

Forever yours,
Your Sweetheart ❤️`;

export const ROMANTIC_WISH = `We may fight and misunderstand each other at times, 
but please don't mistake that for a lack of care.
I struggle to express it, but you are someone I genuinely value.
Even when I fail to show it right, you're still my priority.`
